# TODO 8-20-2023

- Basic Refactor of the Vector Search tool (just to verify metered billing is working)
- Move Credits system entirely to `Usage Credits`
- Page Mode For Summarization
- Add `What's your profession?`
- Set up Kalygo company email
- Collaboration features
- Make `Buy Credits` page a 3 step wizard
- Clean out Kalygo or Shrimp Society usage data
- Next week do in-depth research on ICP's
- Need to add ratings to custom request and mobile view for Summary Tool

## Notes from meeting with Roly Vicaria

- Kalygo does not have a killer use case or does not solve a big enough pain point for any known ICP
- Need collaboration features to audit the output of the LLM
- Store prompts
- Publish Stats on home page
- Templating Contracts
- docx support up next -> then links -> then audio
- Diff Tool
- Add milestone on Pitch Deck
